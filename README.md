1. Overview
This repository contains my completed solutions for Practical 1: SQL Fundamentals, based on the BrightLight Data Analytics SQL training case study.
The aim of this practical was to build a solid foundation in basic SQL syntax, using the Snowflake Data Warehouse environment.

2. The exercises are designed to test understanding of essential SQL concepts such as:
SELECT
SELECT DISTINCT
WHERE filtering
Aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, SUM, etc.)
GROUP BY
HAVING
CASE expressions

3. Learning Objectives is to practise and focuses on mastering:
* Basic SQL retrieving
Retrieve records using SELECT, return specific fields, and explore distinct values.
* Filter conditions
Apply the WHERE clause using logical operators, ranges, exclusions, and categories.
* Aggregations
Perform data summarization using SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN.
* Grouping results
Group data by categories to derive insights (e.g., revenue per gender or product category).
* Conditional logic
Use the CASE statement to classify or categorize data within queries.
